Used for static site hosted in AWS

Background:
Was asked by a friend if I could create him a simple site to use for his business to send customers to in place of his facebook profile. I am not a web developer but had already did some work on the Cloud Resume Challenge and knew I could host this in an s3 bucket. Configured the CSS/HTML files for a simple static site, added images, and created the terraform configuraiton for the infrastructure and put them all into this repo. Setup Github Actions to update all necessary files on a push.
